# Fake-News-Detection

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

It is common these days, twitter is more often used as a platform to spread fake news (since it is more authenticative)
It is being misused for spreading fake news and messages that can lead to communal agitations,fake alarms over natural calamities,hoax information on contagious diseases etc..,using fake social media profiles. A web based tool is to developed to identify such fake accounts and activities and report to government departments concerned.

APPROACH:

1)First we have to get the access to twitter using Devoloper's API key.<br/>
2)Tweets will be extracted from twitter and runned through the proposed algorithms.<br/>
3)After performing Natural Language Processing on the tweet they are labelled accordingly(Fake,Real)<br/>
4)Later the fake accounts are listed out to either twitter or concern authorities to block the accounts.<br/>
