To feed today's global population, we currently need a farm land equal to the size of South America. Despite the excessive amount of land already allocated for agriculture, an estimated 815 million people worldwide still sleep hungry each night. In addition, by the end of 2050 the worldwide population is estimated to be 9 billion. Modern cities of the world already have half the world's population, which follows that the effect of projected growth in the global population will be drastically reduced by the habitable land to maintain modern infrastructure to extreme levels. Urban areas are not built for agriculture but a rapidly changing world already lacking land with hunger and agricultural difficulties inspired us to come up with a solution that can redefine the way we think about agriculture.

'Nurture' is a decentralized urban farming platform where individuals could lease empty spaces like backyards or basements to produce food using urban farming methods. Our platform incentivizes urban population into farming by providing them a decentralized market place to sell their fresh produce directly to consumers in their neighborhoods. We are focusing on impact track and our product meets the following UN Sustainable Development Goals:

1.End Hunger\
2.Sustainable cities and communities\
3.Reduction in forest loss and land degradation\
4.Climate Action\
5.Sustainable production pattern

[BlockChain]

We deployed a smart contract on rinkeby ethereum network which stores the ipfs hash of the document hosted on a decentralized Interplanetary FileSystem.\
We do this because hosting a document in general on a blockchain is an expensive affair. We can address large amount of data with ipfs and place the immutable, permanent ipfs links into a blockchain transaction.\
This timestamps and secures the documents on an immutable ledger and can be sent to the intended person in the form of an ipfs hash.

To get the image from the ipfs hash:
